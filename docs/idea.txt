one script that takes
    * the name of an executable , 
    * a function that returns a list of input params
    * an output dir
the script runs each dir and filespec combo, and presents the output errorlevel, and asks if this is the expected outcome
if yes or no, it stores the result for future use

on future runs, it checks if the output for that combination has already been recorded and verifies that the output is as expected,and prints out a pass/fail message
